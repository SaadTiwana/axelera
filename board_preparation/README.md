**1. Flashing the board**
Step 1



**2. Installing RTL8822CE driver (Wifi + BT)**
Step 2



**3. Set up SD card to extend storage and swap file**
The RK3588 board comes with 32GB of Flash storage. After the ubuntu 22 image is installed on the board it only leaves ~10GB storage available, which is quite small and fills up really quickly. Hence extending it with a fast SD card or a M.2 SSD is very important. 


Setting up SWAP file is also recommended for the 8GB RAM version of the Aetina RK3588 board.


**4. Install Docker**



**5. Install Voyager SDK**
