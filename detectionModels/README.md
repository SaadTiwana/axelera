Two mosdels are uploaded:

1. The yolo11m model trained in ultralytics hub, and downloaded in pyTorch format 

2. Model quantized for Axelera metis via Degirum-hub online compiler


NOTE: The first model in pyTorch format was what was fed into the degirum online compmiler to create the quantized model. The quantized model can be directly used on Axelera hardware using Degirum's pysdk.
